🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
This project demonstrates how to detect plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python via a Jupyter Notebook.
It leverages image classification to help identify common plant leaf diseases.

📌 Project Overview
Plant diseases can significantly reduce agricultural productivity and lead to economic losses. 
This project uses image-based classification to detect diseases in plant leaves. 
The model is trained using a dataset of plant leaf images categorized by type and disease.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV (if used for preprocessing)
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset includes labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. The images are preprocessed and used to train a CNN model for classification.
